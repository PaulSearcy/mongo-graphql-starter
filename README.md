# mongo-graphql-starter

**Warning - this project is extremely young and still rough around the edges. Don't use it for any kind of serious production use.**

This utility will scaffold a basic GraphQL schema and resolvers, with filters working out of the box, based on metadata you enter about your Mongo db.

The philosophy of this project is to auto-generate the repetative boilerplate needed for a graphQL endpoint, while leaving you free to code up all your odd or advanced edge cases as needed.

## How do you use it?

Let's work through a smple example.

First, create your db metadata like this.  Each mongo collection you'd like added to your GraphQL endpoint needs to contain the table name, and all of the fields, keyed off of the data types provided.

**projectSetupA.js**
```javascript
import { dataTypes } from "mongo-graphql-starter";
const { MongoId, String, Int, Float, ArrayOf } = dataTypes;

const Author = {
  table: "authors",
  fields: {
    _id: MongoId,
    name: String
  }
};

const Book = {
  table: "books",
  fields: {
    _id: MongoId,
    title: String,
    pages: Int,
    weight: Float,
    authors: ArrayOf(Author)
  }
};

export default {
  Author,
  Book
};
```

Now tell mongo-graphql-starter to created your schema and resolvers, like this

```javascript
import { createGraphqlSchema } from "mongo-graphql-starter";
import projectSetup from "./projectSetupA";

import path from "path";

createGraphqlSchema(projectSetup, path.resolve("./test/testProject1"));
```

There should now be a graphQL folder containing schema, resolver, and type metadata files for each type, as well as a master resolver and schema file which are aggregates over all the types.

Now fire up express and connect it to the GraphQL schema that was just createdâ€”don't forget to add a root object with a `db` property that resolves to a connection to your database.

```javascript
import { MongoClient } from "mongodb";
import expressGraphql from "express-graphql";
import resolvers from "./graphQL/resolver";
import schema from "./graphQL/schema";
import { makeExecutableSchema } from "graphql-tools";
import express from "express";

const app = express(),
  dbPromise = MongoClient.connect("mongodb://localhost:27017/mongo-graphql-starter"),
  root = {
    db: dbPromise
  },
  executableSchema = makeExecutableSchema({ typeDefs: schema, resolvers });

app.use(
  "/graphql",
  expressGraphql({
    schema: executableSchema,
    graphiql: true,
    rootValue: root
  })
);
app.listen(3000);
```

Now `http://localhost:3000/graphql` should, assuming the database above exists, and has data, allow you to run basic queries against your data

## A closer look at what's generated

All code generated is modern JavaScript, meaning ES6, plus async / await and object spread, along with ES6 modules (`import` / `export`).  If you're running Node 8.5 or better, and you're using John Dalton's [outstanding ESM loader](https://github.com/standard-things/esm) (and I'd urge you to do so) then this code should just work.  If any of those conditions are false, you'll need to pipe the results through Babel using your favorite build tool.

### All code is extensible.  

All of the schema and resolver files discussed below, including the master schema and resolver files, are only generated the first time; if you run the utility again, they will not be written over (though an option to override that may be added later).  The idea is that generated schema and resolver files are only a start, not a final product.  Additional, one-off tweaks can safely be added to your schema and resolver, as needed.

### Generated schema files

The book schema file generatd from the setup above looks like this

```javascript
export const type = `

type Book {
  _id: String
  title: String
  pages: Int
  weight: Float
  authors: [Author]
}

`;

export const query = `

  allBooks(
    title: String,
    title_contains: String,
    title_startsWith: String,
    title_endsWith: String,
    pages: Int,
    pages_lt: Int,
    pages_lte: Int,
    pages_gt: Int,
    pages_gte: Int,
    weight: Float,
    weight_lt: Float,
    weight_lte: Float,
    weight_gt: Float,
    weight_gte: Float
  ): [Book]

  getBook(_id: String): Book

`;
```

Each field that you set up in your meta data of course gets added to you main type. Basic queries have also been created, namely `allBooks` with  filters set up depending on their type; and a `getBook` query that looks up a book by _id. 

### Filters created

WIP - see the schema file above for now

### Resolvers created 

The Book resolver looks like this

```javascript
import { decontructGraphqlQuery } from "mongo-graphql-starter";
import Book from "./Book";

export default {
  Query: {
    async allBooks(root, args, context, ast) {
      let db = await root.db,
        { filters, requestedFields, projections } = decontructGraphqlQuery(args, ast, Book);

      return (await db.collection("books").find(filters, projections)).toArray();
    },
    async getBook(root, args, context, ast) {
      let db = await root.db,
        { filters, requestedFields, projections } = decontructGraphqlQuery(args, ast, Book);

      return await db.collection("books").findOne(filters, projections);
    }
  }
};
```

The graphQL AST is parsed to determine which fields were requested, and only they are queried from Mongo.  And of course the args are translated to the proper Mongo queries.
